The concept for this project was spawned from recognising the opening in the market for applications that could assist tradesmen in getting more business and also for clients that want to find tradesmen and get quotes on jobs quicker and easier.

First, through literature reviews and research we explored the possible routes that we could go about in bringing this project to life. Next, to achieve this concept we decided to make the project a web application that we would build using the Symfony Web Application Framework. After that, we designed the project using various UML techniques and also mapped out how we would proceed in completing this project.  The code for the project was then written using PhpStorm as the primary IDE and was then tested using different testing techniques.

All in all, we as a team believe we have managed to touch on all of the major aspects that were expected of us when conducting this group project. We believe that it is a viable product that can easily be utilised by members of the public and experienced tradesmen.
